#The query aims to extract data on the total number of chocolate bars sold in 2022 by sales representatives who joined the company in 2010. It joins the salesreps #table (sales representatives) with the orders table (orders) using the srid column (sales representative ID). The query filters the data to include only sales #representatives who joined in 2010 and made sales during 2022 (defined as the date range from January 1 to December 31, 2022). It then calculates the total #quantity of chocolate bars sold by each sales representative and displays their name alongside the total quantity sold.
